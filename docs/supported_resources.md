# Supported Resources

*Note: This may not reflect the resources supported by your binary. For OSS builds (available for versions up to 0.13.0), run `terraform-validator list-supported-resources` to get an up-to-date list for your binary.*

If you want terraform validator to add support for a resource, please [open an enhancement request](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraform-validator/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=enhancement.md) and consider [contributing code](./contributing/index.md).

The full list of supported resources can be found in our [GCP Terraform docs](https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/policy-validation/create-cai-constraints#supported_resources).
